# HyperService
An HyperService is bootstrapped to be a micro-service with a *graphql interface* (HTTP) and a *kafka interface* (Messaging) 

An Hyperservice allows communication through graphql from api gateways for external connections, while communication between microservice to microservice can be through *kafka pb:sub system*
